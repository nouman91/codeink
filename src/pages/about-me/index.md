Hi, there I am Nouman Waheed. I am an award-winning software engineer from Islamabad. I have over 5 years in JavaScript and related technologies.

Some words about my professional life: I graduated from university with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. Straight out of university I started working as a  .Net programmer on a large scale project. After a year or so working in .Net/Java I never really felt comfortable with either one of them. I hated the inherent complexity of these languages. All the hoops you have to go through to just to get them working. That's where I decided to learn JavaScript and shortly after I started working on a large scale project in React/Node.js. I loved the language I have been working on it for over 5 years now.

## Passion beyond progamming 
Even though I love programming and I do a lot of it in my professional life and in my spare, I tressure other things too. I am an avid book reader. I love reading all kinds of books but I am especially fond of noval/fantasy books. Some of my absolute favorite books are:
* The Book Theif by [Markus Zusak](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19063.The_Book_Thief)
* I am the Messanger by [Markus Zusak](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19057.I_Am_the_Messenger)
* To Kill a Mockingbird by [Harper Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2657.To_Kill_a_Mockingbird)
* Go Set a Watchman by [Harper Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24817626-go-set-a-watchman)
* 1984 by [George Orwell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427-1984)
* King of the Castle [Charles Le Gai Eaton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/683887.King_of_the_Castle)

I also love traveling. I have traveled extensively in Pakistan. Every year I plan a big road trip to the countryside.  I also do small regular trips.

The most important part of my life is my wife and my family.  I have two amazing daughters and an amazing wife. She is the love of my life and she is a lead QA engineer. Most of my days are centered around then and I cherish every moment I spend with them.
